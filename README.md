🚀 Built an End-to-End Credit Risk Scorecard (PD Model)

Recently completed a credit risk scorecard project where I designed and implemented a full Probability of Default (PD) modeling pipeline using industry-standard techniques.

What I worked on:

WOE binning & Information Value (IV) based feature selection

Multicollinearity handling using VIF

Logistic Regression for PD estimation

Model validation using KS, Gini & AUC

Scorecard scaling (Base score, PDO)

Customer-level credit score generation

This project focuses on the PD layer of credit risk modeling and follows practices commonly used in banking & lending risk teams.
